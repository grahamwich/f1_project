Attempt to predict/classify the time penalties for F1 racing cars.

Currently, racers are given penalties in the form of seconds added to their total lap times if they make illegal movements with their cars while corning. These penalties are decided by human judges. This project aims to introduce AI to assist these decisions, possibly through object detection methods.
